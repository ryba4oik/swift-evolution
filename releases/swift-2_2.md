Swift 2.2 - Released on March 21, 2016
This release focused on fixing bugs, improving quality-of-implementation (QoI) with better warnings and diagnostics, improving compile times, and improving performance. It put some finishing touches on features introduced in Swift 2.0, and included some small additive features that don't break Swift code or fundamentally change the way Swift is used. As a step toward Swift 3, it introduced warnings about upcoming source-incompatible changes in Swift 3 so that users can begin migrating their code sooner.

Aside from warnings, a major goal of this release was to be as source compatible as practical with Swift 2.0.
